# fetch
My info fetch script. Minimalistic (for the most part).

Note: There are 2 versions.

fetch - BASH version. Has 3 layouts (minimal, normal, and extra).

main.rs - Source for the rust version. You'll need to compile yourself.
	- The source code may or may not make you want to bleach your eyes. I'm still new to rust.

Note 2: Wow, the rust version is at least 3 times faster than the BASH version.

### Requirements
1. `lshw` for the GPU info.
2. ![tewisay](https://github.com/lucy/tewisay) and my ![blank cow file](https://github.com/Phate6660/dotfiles/blob/master/Cow%20Files/blank.cow) for the nice looking borders.
3. `checkupdate` for the pending updates section.
